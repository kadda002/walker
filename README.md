# walker

The goal of this project is to automate some basic functions of my computer. I want my computer to turn on when I enter the room and the screens to turn off when someone else enters the room.

This project would be mostly done in python and C++.

Step 1 is to track a person.

Step 2 would be to verify identity.

Step 3 would be to set up wake up on lan.

Step 4 is to figure out how to only turn off the monitors.
